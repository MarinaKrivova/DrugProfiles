## Cancer Research: Predicting drug-response curves
Main parts of the project:
1. EDA
2. Data Preprocessing:
- Data Filtering
- Drug Curves Fitting
3. Adding additional drug features and hyperparameters GridSearch
4. Algorithm 1 - drug-by-drug training for "fit-predict-reconstruct"
5. Algorithm 2 - all-drugs training for "fit-predict-reconstruct"
6. Algorithm 3 - "predict one-by-one"
7. Reconstruction of drug response curves and final analysis
